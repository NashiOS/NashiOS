# NashiOS
Unix-like operating system.

## About

NashiOS is a hobby operating system with a Unix-like core, initially designed for the x86 architecture, but with future
plans to be ported to other platforms. Its name comes from the pear-nashi,
nashi [(Pyrus pyrifolia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_pyrifolia) and is sometimes called the Asian pear. Nashi
pears are widely cultivated for their sweet fruit, a popular food in East Asia.
